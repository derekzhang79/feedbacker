*Because Feedback is a Gift!*
-----------------------------

This is web app designed to facilitate the collection of feedback for and
individual.  There is a specific workflow around the nomination of people to
provide the feedback, submission and review, and distribution.

The nature of the feedback is in the form of a configurable set of questions 
with pick list answers and a free text comments section.  All questions are optional by design since any feedback is better than none.
